# Asr CTC
This repository provides a Jupyter notebook for (CTC) based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using TensorFlow and Keras. The primary focus of this repository is to demonstrate the implementation of a CTC ASR model and to show how to train it effectively on the "Yes No" dataset.

# Usage:
Feel free to use this repository as a starting point for your ASR projects or as a learning resource to understand CTC-based ASR systems using TensorFlow Keras. The included "Yes No" dataset is ideal for getting started with ASR experiments.
